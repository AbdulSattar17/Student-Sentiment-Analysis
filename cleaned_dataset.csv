way_of teaching is good,1
university teaching here is very_much dependent upon slides though it is a easy way_of teaching but still leaving some concepts unclear otherwise interaction_with the faculty is good lecture_delivery sometimes is not_upto the_mark and punctuality is fine,-1
as compared to other colleges and university our_university is perfect in all the aspects,1
lectures helps in clear our concept,1
talk about punctuality it_s really good but the lecture_delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching so lack of knowledge in_terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring a teacher should be entertaining as well but they are really not all they want us_to be studios and disciplined which is really not the thinking of every_student,-1
university is very good at delivering proper lectures also the interaction_with students is descent sometimes the teachers lack in_terms of punctuality but overall university is giving a good input,1

interaction is very good accurate supplement material is provided but recommendation of books is very poor the change of a particular teacher after 3 months or a semester of same subject causes problems,-1
it is really gud,1
very good teaching and management but too much load on student and working hours,-1
in_terms of lecture_delivery that is good in_terms of punctuality that is also good but in_terms of intraction that is very_bad there are some teachers they donot interact and do not litsn our problms that means they_do not coprate,-1
according to me everything is going well in accordance to interaction more_than enough is served,1
not effective and satisfactory_in terms_of lecture_delivery by all the faculty,-1
it is good depending_on the faculty,1
maintained punctuality good lecture_delivery,1

some of our faculty member are not_so experienced that_s why most_of the time we are facing problems subjects like cse c plus plus,-1
its to good,1
everything is good,1
everything is good but when coming to some lectures who dont have_a good grip_on subject they_dont behave well with_students and they_dont even teach all the concepts in the subject,-1
everything was good_regarding to university but some_lecturers don_t have grip_on the subject and lag in the teaching,-1
teaching_activities of our_university is good i_am satisfied_with it,1
everything is good for faculty,-1

good but not good sir improve the subject,-1
the university is good but_it also has a long way to go more teachers should have their phd and college fests related to academic curriculum must_be improved to a great extent and must_be managed properly the interaction is good lecture_delivery needs more lucidity the punctuality is top notch,1
our_university is good in punctuality lecture_delivery but_it is not good in_terms of interaction,-1
interaction is very less when it comes to lecture_delivery its fine but the co cordination not there between the lectueres,-1
all lectures are giving their best to teach the students,1
our_university is very good but in_terms of interaction of teachers wd students is not at all fair because they_interact wd only students understands his/her teaching they don_t make remaining students to_understand the topic,-1
the university consists of a whole world in itself it is diverse and manages to conduct all events properly i love being the part of this_university where_we get equal and all opportunities in all respects and fields,1
teachers_are pretty interactive but_it all depends_on the student to gain as much as knowledge he can from the teacher teachers_are punctual and very helpful during exams time,1
teaching delivery is good but_it is better to reduce there speed_of lecture_delivery to_understand the student better,1
overall rating on this activity is 4 5/5 very nice teaching and interaction_between students and lectures was good every time there will be new and fresh style in delivering the lectures thanks,1
excellent_but reduse the speed_of teaching up_to understand the students,1
teaching is ok but the interaction_with the students need to_improve i mean they have to focus on dull students more_than intelligents,-1
interaction is good but_it should b more rest is too perfect,1
teachers_are good in subject and punctuality,1
everything would be fine if there are less number of students in our btech cse,-1
faculties are doing quite well but need more senior lecturers,1
examination department is not good teaching is quite_good i cant get extra time for extra knowledge interaction is good,-1
well and good,1
university management is extordinary but some of the faculty is very_bad,-1
some lectures are excellent_but not everyone,-1
it is very good learning in_this university,1
its booring,-1
teaching is good but some_lecturers are_showing partiality_between south_people and north_people,-1
teaching is good but some teachers_are not_able to interact properly and are not_able to clear the concepts properly teachers_are punctual,-1
everything is very good interaction part is something like teachers mostly interact with each and every_student lecture_delivery is very good and punctuality_always maintains,1
i_am very_much satisfied_with teaching faculty interms of iteraction lecture_delivery punctuality etc,1
they are_showing partiality_between north_indians and south_indians,-1
interaction is satisfying lecture_delivery is good punctuality is excellent,1
staff is showing_partiality between_north indians and south_indians,-1
excellent university the mode of teaching is completely different than any other_university in india lecturers_are very friendly with every one they_interact just like friends and they are very_punctual,1
lecture_delivery and punctuality was good but the interaction_with students was not good,-1
punctuality and lecture is good here but interaction isn t good,-1
good enough,1
in_this university there is good interaction_with the students teachers in_this university can deliver the lectures effectively there is good punctuality in_this university,1

teaching is good some_lecturers are_showing partiality_between south_people and north_people,-1
i was a student of a boarding school jnv i studied for 7 years there residing in hostel now living in lpu is same like that and still more same and punctuality is shown here by both teachers and students and also by the staff security is above 90 in case of student is well manured classes regular sports daily participation well/ quality below average,1
all terms are good_regarding the university_activities,1
intraction is good and leacture delivery also good and then punctuality is also is good,1
all the given terms are good_regarding the university,1
all the terms are good_regarding the university_activities,1
some of the teacher are un experienced also they are unfair and baised infact many of the teachers_are having few or no experience about the subject,-1
it is going good,1
not_satisfactory lab_work must include latest technologies,-1
lab_work is properly covered in the labs by the faculty and evaluations help to learn more practical_knowledge in depth,-1
lab and practical are not_upto the_mark the topic which are practiced are almost already done in btech,1
the evaluation is again bad for our ca as one of our faculty is really weird he gives us remarks on the_basis of how we present things in front of it he never look for the content of our answer which is really annoying as he expects us_to deliver answer in the way he wants us_to do but how can a person do that as people do have different mentality and they_do explain themselves in different manner so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the_basis of what_they say not what_they should say,-1
it is difficult to_understand experiment in 1 hour,-1
lab activities are good but not_satisfactory in explaining point of view,-1
that_s good to have_a negative marking pattern in_exam but the time is not sufficient to_do all the questions,-1
paper_checking is very hard remaining is good,1
excellent_but checking procedure is not exceptable since we fail to_know our faults in mid term,-1
the examination system of the university is very impressive the sitting plan of he students is made in such a way that no 2 students of same class give the exam in same room or even sometimes same blocks through this students also get to_know and visit different blocks of the university the checking is also fair,1
its very_bad thing not sowing answer of mcq in_exam we dont jiged what is rigth and rong where_we made mistake,-1
marks distribution is good but paper_checking is not that well,-1
