"Talk about punctuality, it's really good but the lecture delivery is somehow not appreciated because every teacher has different style of teaching, so lack of knowledge in terms of subject is there and interaction is also kind of boring.

"not satisfactory, lab work must include latest technologies",-1,59

Lab and practical are not upto the mark. The topic which are practiced are almost already done in Btech.,1,104
"The evaluation is again bad for our CA, as one of our faculty is really weird. He gives us remarks on the basis of how we present things in front of it, he never look for the content of our answer, which is really annoying. As he expects us to deliver answer in the way he wants us to do. But how can a person do that, as people do have different mentality and they do explain themselves in different manner, so a teacher must understand that quality of a child and should give him marks on the basis of what they say not what they should say.",-1,543
it is difficult to understand experiment in 1 hour,-1,50
lab activities are good but not satisfactory in explaining point of view.,-1,73
